# plentific-challenge

Code created for Plentific hiring process coding chalenge.

## Git and venv

There is a .sh file with the record of some commands used to work with Git and virtual environments.

## Working with Postgres

Used [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) to run a local Postgres database. Also, used pgAdmin4 to create the database.

## PPD data
The data was donwloaded from [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads#single-file) and to define what each column represents I used information found [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-the-price-paid-data#explanations-of-column-headers-in-the-ppd).

I only used a sample (attached the file) of the data to speed things up.

## Jupyter
I used jupyter notebooks to better strucure and test my code
